# CRIBS
Last academic year I had a task to create a commercial website for a fictional real estate agency. I have delivered this project fully by myself, starting from the client's brief (role played by the lecturer), estimating functional and non-functional requirements and implementing it using agile methodology till full deployment and testing. I used CSS, JavaScript and HTML for frontend development and SQL for writing database which i desighned myself as well. I used XAMPP to deliver this project which means i hosted it as a local server and used PHP to communicate with MariaDB. Most of the code wasn't written by me but taken from various snippets of code from college tutorials and other online resources. I have created and used a testing plan for functional requirements and worked on debugging. Unfortunately, I can't share my documentation publicly.
